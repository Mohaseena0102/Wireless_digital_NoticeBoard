AIM: The main aim of this project is to replace traditional physical notice boards with a dynamic, remotely updatable digital display. The project utilizes the LPC2148 microcontroller, interfacing with a dot matrix LED display to show messages such as announcements, alerts, or notices. The system operates wirelessly via Bluetooth communication, allowing users to update the displayed content from a mobile device.
